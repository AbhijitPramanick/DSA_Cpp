//************* Inheritance in C++ *************

// Overview:
/*      1. Reusability is very impotant feature of OOPs
        2. In C++ we can reuse a class and add addtional features to it.
        3. Reusing classes aves time and money.
        4. Reeusing alreasdy tested  and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again. 

    What is inheritance in C++?
        1. The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance.
        2. We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it.
        3. The existing class is called base class.(More than one base class can be there for a single derived class)
        4. The new class which is inherited is called derived class.
        5. Reusing classes saves time and money.
        5. There are different types of inheritance in C++.

    Forms of inheritance:
        1. Single inheritance
            -A derived class with only one base class.
            -Derived class = base class + more...
        2. Multiple inheritance.
            -A derived class with more than one base class.
        3. Hierarchical inheritance.
            -Several derived class from single base class.
        4. Multilevel inheritance.
            -Deriving a class from already derived class.
        5. Hybrid inheritance.
            -Hybrid inheritance is the combinatrion of muliple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
            -A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
            -However one of th parent class in not a base class.
